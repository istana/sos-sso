This is modification of dialup.conf from freeRADIUS 2.x. The main changes are that some attributes were renamed,
becasuse they collided with reserved attributes in Ruby on Rails. It is not compatible with the original schema.sql!

The other change was change of postauth_query to not log user passwords in cleartext.
